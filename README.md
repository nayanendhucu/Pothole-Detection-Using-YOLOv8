# Pothole Detection Using YOLOv8

## Overview

This project implements an object detection system for identifying potholes in road images using YOLOv8.

The model is trained to locate potholes using bounding-box annotations and can identify the position of potholes within an image rather than simply classifying whether a pothole is present.

The project covers dataset preparation, annotation conversion, YOLO-format dataset organization, model training, validation, and pothole detection on images.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Annotated Potholes Image Dataset** originally created by Atikur Rahman Chitholian.

### Kaggle Dataset

[Annotated Potholes Image Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitholian/annotated-potholes-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The original dataset contains 665 road images with annotated potholes. The dataset was subsequently exported in YOLOv8 format for object detection.

### Dataset Distribution

| Split      | Images |
| ---------- | -----: |
| Training   |    466 |
| Validation |    134 |
| Testing    |     68 |
| Total      |   668* |

The dataset source documentation states 665 images; the exported directory structure contains 466 training, 134 validation, and 68 test images. The repository therefore preserves the exported dataset structure rather than modifying the source counts.

### Classes

The project contains one object-detection class:

```text
pothole
```

## Objective

The primary objective is to develop a computer vision model capable of automatically detecting potholes in road images.

The system predicts:

* Whether a pothole is present
* The location of the pothole
* The bounding box surrounding the detected pothole
* The model confidence for each detection

## Technology Stack

* Python
* YOLOv8
* Ultralytics
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Google Colab
* Roboflow YOLOv8 dataset format

```

## Dataset Preparation

The original pothole annotations were converted into YOLO-compatible label files.

Each annotation follows the YOLO object-detection format:

```text
class_id x_center y_center width height
```

The dataset configuration is defined in `data.yaml`.

```yaml
nc: 1
names: ['pothole']
```

The dataset uses separate directories for:

```text
train/
valid/
test/
```

Each split contains corresponding image and label directories.

## Model

The project uses **YOLOv8 Nano (`yolov8n`)** for pothole detection.

YOLOv8 is a one-stage object detection architecture designed to perform object localization and classification efficiently.

The Nano variant provides a lightweight model suitable for experimentation and deployment on systems with limited computational resources.

## Training Configuration

The model is trained using the YOLOv8 training pipeline.

Key configuration includes:

| Parameter        | Value            |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Model            | YOLOv8n          |
| Task             | Object Detection |
| Classes          | 1                |
| Input Image Size | 640 × 640        |
| Epochs           | 50               |
| Dataset Format   | YOLOv8           |
| Target Class     | Pothole          |

## Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using object-detection metrics such as:

* Precision
* Recall
* mAP@50
* mAP@50–95
* Training and validation losses

The project also performs inference on validation/test images to visually inspect detected potholes and their bounding boxes.

## Inference

After training, the best model weights can be used to detect potholes in new images.

Example workflow:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("best.pt")

results = model.predict(
    source="test_image.jpg",
    imgsz=640,
    conf=0.25
)
```

The output contains detected pothole bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## Applications

A pothole detection system can be used as a foundation for:

* Automated road-condition monitoring
* Road maintenance systems
* Smart-city infrastructure monitoring
* Vehicle-mounted road inspection
* Road-damage mapping
* Infrastructure maintenance prioritization

## Limitations

The dataset contains a single object class and a relatively small number of images compared with large-scale object-detection datasets.

Performance may also vary depending on:

* Lighting conditions
* Camera angle
* Pothole size
* Road surface
* Image quality
* Weather conditions
* Occlusion
* Distance from the pothole

The model should therefore be evaluated on independent real-world road images before being considered for practical deployment.

## Future Improvements

* Train with a larger and more diverse road dataset
* Add additional road-damage classes
* Perform hyperparameter tuning
* Compare YOLOv8 model sizes
* Apply controlled data augmentation
* Evaluate performance on real-world dashcam footage
* Implement real-time video detection
* Add GPS-based pothole mapping
* Develop a road-condition monitoring dashboard
* Deploy the model on an edge device
